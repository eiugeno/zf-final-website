            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Boosted Batteries is a sub-company of ZF Friedrichshafen, dedicated to pioneering sustainable energy solutions for commercial vehicle fleets. We understand that the electrification of commercial fleets is often hindered by high initial costs and the need to frequently replace aging batteries.</p>
            <p>By giving second life to dismissed batteries (those below 80% capacity), we create efficient, large-scale battery racks. These racks store off-peak electricity at a low cost, which is then used to charge fleets of retrofitted commercial vehicles. Our approach dramatically reduces the environmental impact of electrification, while making it financially attractive and operationally smooth for fleet owners.</p>

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>We aim to accelerate the adoption of clean transport solutions by making them more accessible, economical, and environmentally friendly. Together with our partner TOLV, we provide a comprehensive solution: retrofitting existing ICE vehicles into electric ones, powering them with second-life batteries, and maintaining those batteries for long-term use.</p>
