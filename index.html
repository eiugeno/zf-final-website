                <h1>Empowering Sustainable Fleets</h1>
                <p>Boosted Batteries, powered by ZF Friedrichshafen, transforms used commercial vehicle batteries into cost-effective, long-lasting energy storage solutions for electrified fleets.</p>

            <h2>What We Do</h2>
            <p>We take dismissed batteries from ZF commercial vehicles and give them a second life. Our battery racks, powered by off-peak electricity, charge a retrofitted electric fleet at a fraction of the cost of new EV investments. With our partner TOLV, we ensure your vehicles are efficiently converted and maintained, reducing environmental impact and extending battery life indefinitely.</p>

                <h3>Cost-Effective</h3>
                <p>Our solution costs significantly less than buying a new electric fleet or performing retrofitting with traditional batteries.</p>

            <div class="highlight">
                <h3>Unlimited Battery Life</h3>
                <p>Our refurbished battery trays are designed for easy cell replacement every few months, ensuring a virtually unlimited lifespan.</p>

                <h3>Environmental Impact</h3>
                <p>By reusing battery cells and maintaining them regularly, we reduce waste and lower the environmental footprint of commercial transport.</p>
